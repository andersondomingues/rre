# 🕹️ SuperH Instruction Set Architecture Implementations

This project aims to provide open-source implementations of the SuperH instruction set architecture (ISA), supporting CPUs compatible with SH-1, SH-2, SH-3, SH-4, and SH-5 cores and their variations. 


## 🚀 Motivation

SuperH CPUs have played a significant role in the evolution of gaming consoles and various embedded products over the years. After extensive work on RISC-V CPUs, this project was started to explore new architectures (old ones, actually) and as an effort to preserve the SuperH ecosystem technology.

The SuperH architecture is open-source, making it an excellent platform for:

- 🎓 **Teaching**: Use these implementations to help students learn about CPU architectures and instruction sets.
- 🔬 **Research**: Employ the CPUs in academic and practical research projects.
- 🛠️ **Development**: Experiment with retro hardware, gaming consoles, and embedded systems.

## 🎯 Goals

- ✅ Implement CPUs that are backwards compatible with all major SuperH standards (SH-1 to SH-5).
- 📚 Provide clear, educational code suitable for teaching and research.
- 🤝 Foster community contributions and collaboration.
- 💡 Write CPUs in SystemVerilog and make extensive use of modern verification methodologies.
- 🏭 Utilize industrial tools from Synopsys, Cadence, and AMD, as these are standard in the industry.

## 🔗 Related Projects

Other open-source SuperH core projects exist and may be ahead in terms of implementation, such as [J-Core](https://github.com/j-core). This project aims to differentiate itself by focusing on SystemVerilog and verification best practices.
